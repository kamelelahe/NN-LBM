This repository contains steps numerical simulation for polymer gel injection in porous media.
we used Palabos open source software developed by University of Geneva as a powerful tool for numerical simulation.
since polymer gel is highly complex fluid, both time-dependant and shear-dependant, required modification, modeling and coding are made to the base code to make it suitable for precisely model this phenomenon in porous media.
